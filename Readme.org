#+TITLE: Analyse your workout in R

Since Garmin Training Center stores your data in a sqlite file, it's now now easy to sweat while analysing your workouts.

* Instructions
** locating the backup files
   - Usually, a ~*.tcd~ file is stored in
   ~C:\Users\*USER*\AppData\Roaming\Garmin\TrainingCenter\Backups~. You
   can request a new backup save via the ~File~ menu in the software.
** obtaining the plots
   - the backup located in the previous section is actually a SQLite file that we'll feed to the ~R/graphs.R~ script.
   - fill in your records in the ~R/load.R~ file - table ~Records~
* Example plots
Here's a few examples based on the data from a person regularly training (running, biking, and swimming). Your imagination is the limit.
** The classics
Plots similar to the one on Garmin Connect.
*** Total weekly distance
 [[./plots/id1_total_weekly_distance.png]]
*** Monthly activity count
 [[./plots/id2_Monthly_act_count.png]]
*** Activity count by year
 [[./plots/id25_Activity_peryear.png]]

** Personal best based
The plots on this section outlines the PBs for Running and Biking (the /red/ dots).
*** Avergare speed vs date - Running
 [[./plots/id21_AvgSpeed_distance_Running.png]]

** other
*** HR vs Activity Starttime
 [[./plots/id3_HR_vs_Starttime.png]]
*** Activity count by day of week
 [[./plots/id6_Activity_dayofWeek.png]]
*** HR vs elapsed time
 [[./plots/id7_HR_etime.png]]
*** total distance by activity
 [[./plots/id14_Total_Distance_byact.png]]
* Notes
  - Garming TC does not name on "other" activities. Those can include walking, swimming, etc
  - Accuracy of the HR monitor can debated.
  - this code is a bit old and lacking some styles that I learned later, namely pipes.
  - Some plots needs the temperature during the activity. Look for a nearby temperature temperature station with open data. If you're in the US there should be plenty.
